mvc just follow division of the work paradigm. We will split our code in 3 different area. Mvc is very popular software paradigm. Most of php framework like  Laravel, codeignite, yii, cake php, symfony following mvc paradigm. Its very simple to understand. 

## view
`view` will show view part like html, iterating data and view for end user.

## controller
Controller do logic part and getting data from model and show view page     

## model   
Model is a data layer. It's responsible for managing data


## Routing   
Route will determine which controller will be loaded based on url route.
